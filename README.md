# TitanBox

## This is a simple app to manage boxes and its copntents.
Allows a user to scan a QR code that must be attatched to a box. I created this initially when I move to a new house and wanted to know what could possibly be in the moving boxes before I opened them.

When a QR is scanned, the user will be able to create it as a new box, adding a name, description and contents list to it and save it with Core Data to their device. If the box already exists, it will show the user the details of the box and allow those details to be edited.
